 Usage:
   npx tsx dev/testScraper.ts "<url to try>"

 Notes:
  - DEPRECATED: 
  - DO NOT USE UNLESS CHANGES ARE MADE TO THE GUARDRAIL LOGIC IN SCRAPER/ROBOTS
  - Use testOrchestration.ts instead, but note to use it sparingly
  - Keep as legacy for now, however a version of scraper that does not ingest
    data will need to be created
